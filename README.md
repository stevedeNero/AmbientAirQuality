# AmbientAirQuality

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the process of full-stack web application development. This application will focus on reporting ambient air quality data in the user's vicinity.  The air quality data reported is all verified and published by the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.  This data is collected at monitors across the US.  The EPA has created a map-based UI where users may zoom into a locale and select available monitors.  However, I have found through my experience of using this feature that the steps required to determine (1) the reported concentration and (2) whether the reported values are considered "valid" by EPA's standards to be too cumbersome. 

Therefore, I am setting out to create a more streamlined reporting tool.
